				<h2>Hugh Allen</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Age: 42</li>
					<li>Education: Sc.M-Harvard</li>
					<li>Occupation: Statistician Entrepreneur</li>
					<li>Income: $120,000 annual</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Work/Life/Balance:</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Hugh runs his own business as a head contractor with a team of 23 sub-contractors for his state's Department of Health bringing quality assurance to Vaccines for Children.</li>
					<li>He was in the Peace Corp and has very close friends within W.H.O. and they visit when in the area. Occasionally and upon need he also travels abroad to meet with them.</li>
					<li>Hugh is so passionate he want to hire a team to build an app and a website to help him in his job and the world at large.</li>
				</ol>


				<h2>Goals:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>To utilize a visual tool that will help health professionals around the globe.</li>
					<li>Bringing public awareness of vaccines and preventable childhood deaths.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Needs:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>To build a team of talented coders and developers to build what is needed for his idea.</li>
					<li>To feel he isn't wasting his time.</li>
					<li>To aid nurses and health professionals in changing the minds of people who are resistant to vaccinations. </li>
				</ul>


				<h2>Challenges:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Although Hugh runs his business with the latest technology, he is only really experienced on the user end. He has a great innovating idea, but needs to outsource the talent he lacks in the programming and coding of his idea.</li>
					<li>Worried about his competence in keeping up with new technology especially when it changes so fast and radically.</li>
					<li>Frustrated at times when he can't find or re-find things in his overcrowded calendar.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Technology:</h2>
				Hugh runs with the latest iPhone, 3 laptops with the latest version of Windows and Microsoft Office and 1 tablet mostly for Netflix when he is away from home.

				<h2>Story:</h2>
				<p>Hugh absolutely loves his job. He feels very fortunate to be where he is and with the experiences and adventure he has acquired over just 32 years.  He enjoys the challenges of finding answers to a wide variety of questions. He is always learning alongside his colleagues and staff and is deeply appreciative of the range of knowledge acquired in his daily work. In addition to checking vaccine quality, Hugh wears many other hats in his organization such as running the backend of a small business, following disease research and development, and teaching workshops.</p>

				<p>Hugh has an innovating idea about how to feed his passion of ending world disease and suffering by building an app that will morph a "selfie" into a photo of one with any given number of diseases and ailments. Unfortunately, Hugh is unable to follow cutting edge development as much as he would like. The majority of work is spent in public service in the field and he doesn't have time to enrich his knowledge base with a lot of personal research. It's often a decision between keeping his business going and exploring technological advancement. As expected, the former always wins out. He realizes he will need to find a talented team of coders and developers to see his idea to fruition.</p>

				<p>Hugh is well connected in both the Health and Technology communities in Albuquerque, NM. He has decided to try to keep his talented team to the Greater Albuquerque Metropolitan Area.</p>
