<!--				Name: Victoria Senolee Hooker<br>-->
<!--				Born: Route 66, Zuzax Exit.. It's now a Park and Ride. Ionic, isn't it?<br>-->
<!--				Career: Creator<br>-->
<!--				Education: Self-taught BS in Life, going for my Masters. If that doesn't kill me, I'll start thinking about my PHD.<br>-->

<!--				Life's Lesson: If you are depressed, you are living in the past. If you are anxious, you are living in the future. Neither is in your control. Live in the moment and do the very best you can. In it's own way, it does soften the past and makes for a stronger tomorrow. <br>-->
