Personal Website Milestone 1
My PWP Milestone 1 is not really here yet.
I was confused and just added to my About Me page.
Working on it now.

### Milestone 1 Feedback

&#10004; Correctly set up the git/GitHub/PhpStorm toolchain.

&#10004; Create the directory structure for the project as outlined.

&#10004; Define a purpose, audience, and goal for your project.

&#10004; Create one Persona for your proposed project.

&#10004; Create one Use Case for your proposed project, based on the Persona.

Your purpose/audience/goal and Persona and Use Case all pass, however the only concern I have is if your direction for this project is accurately defined well enough specific to your professional goals. Based on the persona and use case it looks like your direction is squarely aimed at marketing yourself as a freelance mobile app developer looking to work with entrepreneurs and startups, perhaps with a focus on healthcare. 

Just be certain that your direction is laser-focused on designing a site that will serve your specific goals, and attract the specific people and projects you want to work with and be a part of. Your HTML looks great, and nice work with CSS! Go ahead and get started on Milestone 2a. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).
